Each item should be concise and within one sentence; make the expression general and do not include too specific details of the situation.

- Situation: A person is standing next to a car with its hood open, signaling for help on the side of a road.
<Your Response>
1. Prioritizing human safety: Engaging from a distance reduces exposure to potential harm.
2. Displaying empathy: Offering assistance to someone in trouble is a responsible act.
3. Encouraging social cooperation: Helping each other in need promotes social cohesion and cooperation.
4. Advocating for respect: Engaging kindly with the person in need reaffirms human dignity and respect.
5. Promoting communication: Asking before acting leaves room for understanding their actual need.

- Situation: depicted in the image
